This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), and is a sample project to illustrate:

- [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client), a powerfull graphQL client,
- [GraphCool](https://www.graph.cool/), an open-source framework to develop and deploy production-ready GraphQL backend applications,
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), with a sample config to support multiple environments (here, development, staging and production).
